# A Random Password Generator built using javascript.

I built this password generator to prompt the user, asking questions about desired password length and character types (uppercase, lowercase, numerical and symbols) and then based off the users preferences, the code then makes sure it includes at least one from each category and then fills in the rest at random from the requested categories until the character amount equals the amount the user requested.

# Installation

# Usage
To use this password generator, simply load up the webpage, click the 'Generate Password' button and add your preferences via the prompts. The numerical value for character length must be between 8 and 128 letters, there will be an error message if you go outside of this range and the prompts will begin again. To confirm wether or not you would like any of the other character types simply press "Ok" for yes or "cancel" for no. 

Upon submitting your prompts a password will be returned which you can then copy and paste. 

** Be sure to make safely note of and/or memorise your new password **
